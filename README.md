For this mini-project, I will be recreating the Google Homepage.

Update 12/22.

After taking the Responsive Web Design class with freeCodeCamp, I came back to this.
In this challenge, I demonstrated my proficiency with HTML and CSS.
There were a few issues I was having with making a horizontal nav bar for the bottom of the page.
For whatever reason, I couldn't get the links to lay horizontally.
It turns out my divs were navs and creating a break between the left and right links.
I also realized that using a style on the link class (a) is much more efficient as spacing links and doesn't create space between works like word-spacing does.
